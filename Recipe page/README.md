## Overview

it is a basic project, but after a long time of just watching tutorials of html and css without doing any project, I decided to do this project. As the first project i did without any help from friends or AI, it was a little harder than i expected. I got to learn that its not just about watching tutorials, but also about doing projects thats what makes you learn and improve.
